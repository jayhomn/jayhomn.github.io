            Hi! My name is Jay Ho and I'm a third year computer science
            student at The University of British Columbia that just finished
            an 8 month co-op at One45 Software! During my co-op experience, I
            worked in full-stack web development (PHP, Javascript, CSS, HTML)
            and worked mainly on their flagship web-app. My assignments were
            no different from the development team's and throughout the term I
            have had experience working throughout the entire stack
            (front-end, back-end, and devops). You can read more on my
            experience in my work section below!
            <br />
            <br />
            <b
              >I am currently looking for summer 2021 internships and I am
              super excited to be able to apply my newly acquired experience
              for you and your company's needs! Contact me to get in touch!</b

              tickets were from the same pool other developers picked from)
              The tickets ranged from product maintenance, company goals, new
              features, technology upgrades, UI/UX upgrades, bug fixes, tech
              debt, etc. Utilized project management tools such as Jira and

              timeline estimations. Created the initial MVC structure for the
              new feature and developed additional services and helper classes
              to connect the feature to the database and support business
              logic. Learned how to effectively manage deadlines and work
              efficiently despite the onset of the pandemic and transitioning

                <b>Description:</b> <br />A web-app built using React that was
                initially used for experimenting with API calls and displaying
                the data in the front-end. This app uses the openweatherapi to
                query the temperature of a city and currently uses a very
                simple condition to construct the google image search query
                that acquires the images to be displayed. The concept for this
                app is to help users find outfit inspiration depending on the
                weather of your city and future plans include implementing
                deep learning to make the search query more dynamic and
                specific. <br /><br />
                <b>Main Contributions:</b><br />
                Prototyped and created the front-end design using React and
                Javascript. Parsed user input for location and used it to make
                an API call to the openweatherapi to get the temperature data.
